Interactive BI dashboard built with **Tableau** to analyze retail sales performance, profitability trends, and product-level insights.

The goal of this project is to answer practical business questions such as:
- Which products generate high revenue but low profit?
- Where are the category-level performance gaps?
- How do sales and profitability change across regions and time?
